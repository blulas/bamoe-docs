First step: Install Apache Maven.
You can find instructions for doing so at https://maven.apache.org/install.html[the Apache Maven website].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Due to https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/31011, we recommend using the latest Apache Maven 3.8 version.

== Project Setup Options
With the migration of the BAMOE product to Quarkus 3 the instructions on how to generate a new Maven project have changee.  Currently, there are a number of options:

* xref:../editing/creating-new-projects.adoc[Use BAMOE Canvas] to create a new project using Canvas' accelerator features..
* **Create Project Manually**

== Creating a BAMOE Project Manually
Typically, Maven projects are created either using plugins or archetypes.  You can use a simple Maven archetype to generate a basic Maven project, for example:

[source,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-simple -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false
----

then update the project's `pom.xml` with content from one of the followin templates:

xref:../partials/rules-sample-pom.adoc[Sample Rules/Decision Application POM Template] a sample POM that describes a typical rules/decisions project dependencies and plugins.

xref:../partials/process-sample-pom.adoc[Sample Process Application POM Template] a sample POM that describes a typical process project dependencies and plugins.

Build the project in the root folder:
[source,console]
----
mvn clean package
----

== Editing within VS Code

. Open the project in VS Code.
  From here we can see the workspace's contents, and if we expand the contents of `/src/main` you will see the creation of several artifacts. 
  Within `java` you will have a `GreetingResource.java` and within `resources` you will have an `application.properties` and `pricing.dmn` file. 
  These are sample files that can be later modified or deleted.
+

. Install {VS_CODE_BUNDLE_LINK}[*{VS_CODE_BUNDLE}*].
  This gives you access to the visual editors for DMN and BPMN files.
  It also allows you to create and edit testing scenarios for projects.
+
image::bamoe-vscode-marketplace.png[{VS_CODE_BUNDLE} within the marketplace]

. Click the `pricing.dmn` file to open it. 
  When you do so, you may be greeted with a message similar to `The current DMN does not have any Diagram associated with it. Do you want to auto-generate it?` 
  If so click `Auto-generate Diagram` to automap the DMN locations.
+

. When the diagram opens you will see something similar to below, and you can start exploring it. 
  The DMN is made up of two inputs: *Age* and *Previous incidents?*, which are used to make the decision, *Base price*.
+

. If you click the *Age* input data node and then click the *Properties* icon on the right, you will open a pane for the input.
+
image::properties-open.png[DMN Properties]

. Within this pane, you can see information about the input *Age*, which includes that it is a number and what the input name is. 
  More can be changed around this object, including the color of the node, font size, etc.
+
image::properties-expanded.png[DMN Properties Expanded]

. To view the Decision, click the square decision node and select the `Edit` button to enter the decision for *Base Price*.
+
image::open-decision.png[Edit DMN Decision]

. From here you will see the Decision Table that is associated with the Base Price decision. 
  From here you will see two (*2*) input columns (`Age` and `Previous Incidents`), as well as one output column (`Base price`) all with their types below them. 
  These types are controlled from the properties panel similarly to how they were opened when looking at `Age` a few steps ago. 
  This decision has 4 different rows that could fire, with a Hit Policy of `UNIQUE` signified by the **U** in the top left corner of the table. 
  A decision writer could make any comments they want to the table and have them saved towards the decision here.

== Create a GitHub repository for the project

You must create a GitHub repository for this service, so that you can store your changes and also take advantage of building it into a cloud service running on OpenShift. 

. You can create a repository on https://github.com[GitHub]. 
  To do this, log in to your GitHub account (or create one if you don't have one!) 
  From your home page, click the green `New` icon near the top left of the page (or you can navigate directly https://github.com/new[here])
+
image::new-repo.png[New Repo]

. Fill out the form with your values

    - **Repository Name**: quick-openshift-kogito
    - Select **Public** for now
    - Add a **Description** if you want
    - Click **Create Repository**
+
image::repo-form.png[Repo Form]

. Create some content to add to your repository.
  GitHub has some recommendations, if you would like to follow them.
+
image::cli-create.png[Sample Command]

. Add, commit, and push this project to your newly created repository via the following commands:
+
[source,console]
----
git add -A
git commit -m "Adding my project"
git push origin
----
+

. When this is done, you are finsihed with this section.
